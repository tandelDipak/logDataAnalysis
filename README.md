Consider a sample topology shown in an image below. It has five nodes A, B, C, D, and E. These nodes are connected with a fiber link. Consider Node A is sending data to node E and node B. While sending data node A generates a log. When node E and node B receives data it also generates a log. Now due to some issue in A-E link node A is generating some particular type of log. But the problem here is we donâ€™t know that particular log is because of an issue in link A-B or link A-E. So, this project tries to solve this issue.
